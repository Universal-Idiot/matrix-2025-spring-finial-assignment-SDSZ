# matrix-2025-spring-finial-assignment-SDSZ
This is a small project on matrix and its operation,  creating for finishing the homework or it should called the finial assignment of the linear algebra class, spring 2025, SDSZ high school. It could be a small project while using Python, but I prefer using this assignment to review the concept of C++ and learning something i want to learn but never had a chance before, like dynamic allocation of memories, “class” in C++, link multi files, setting up VS code, and start to use Github. This project is about to develop an encapsulated class of matrix and vector with some interface to use.  I know there is plenty of well-developed and convenient lib of such things, and doing matrix calculations  is more easier on some software like Matlab, but I am learning linear algebra, and doing this project is a chance to help me review the concept (I know it cannot help me understanding, which only can done by doing the proofing by myself, but it can make me more familiar to those concept, is still gonna help some effect). OK, that’s it. Further descriptions will be the manual of this project, written below this block.
